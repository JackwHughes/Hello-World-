# Pseudocode for the algorithm:
# 1. Request input from the user to store as 'password'
# 2. Request a second input to compare with the password
# 3. If second input matches password, output password and incorrect inputs
# 4. If second input does not match, store the incorrect input and prompt again
# 5. Repeat until correct password is entered and output the results

Username = input ("Please enter your Username")
print("your username is:", Username)

Age = input("Please insert your age?")
print = ("Your Age is:", Age)

print ("Hello World!")
